# Spatial-Database
Designed a JDBC application with a spatial database as back-end which stores information of USC tram-stops, 
buildings inside the campus and student locations to perform different queries on the database. 
The application gives information regarding the nearest tram stops to a student along with the buildings covered 
by a tram stop and helps the USC Transportation Department improve their services by moving tram stops so that 
they can cover maximum students and buildings.
